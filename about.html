  <h3 id="headTwo">Who are We?</h3>
<p>We like acting the way we think. We live in a time where, as food-consumers, we ask ourselves questions beyond the taste
of food.

As a team, we have some very enriching internal discussions on various topics: Do we only want organic-certified
products available for purchase? Should we only allow vegan products? What is more environment-friendly: a can or a
glass bottle? How much water is needed to produce certain foods? Should we be formal or friendly with the people who
write to us? What methods of transport should we use? Everything is debatable as long as we do it respectfully.

We like undertaking these decisions with an open mind, and while being true to our values. We won't fall in the trap of
trying to please everyone.</p>

<h3 id="headThree">What we do</h3>
<p>We foster an agricultural market that guarantees respect for local practices and traditions. We support an inclusive
culture that favours social and cultural exchanges, seeking not to impose global, but multi-local solutions.

What does this mean? It means there's no one-size-fits-all formula. We want to understand, integrate, and love the
idiosyncrasies of each market where CrowdFarming Farmers produce their crops.We foster an agricultural market that
guarantees respect for local practices and traditions. We support an inclusive culture that favours social and cultural
exchanges, seeking not to impose global, but multi-local solutions.</p>
