  <h3>We are waiting for you</h3>
  <p>Consumers are more and more aware of food waste. The waste we see is the one we produce at home or at the point of sale,
  but there's a lot of waste that the consumer doesn't see. For example, the waste of crops grown and that will never be
  harvested, or the waste of fruits that don't pass the (alleged) beauty standards that the traditional market demands.
  
  CrowdFarming fights against food waste at the source thanks to adoptions. When you adopt something, you allow the Farmer
  to grow a crop knowing that someone will consume it. In the food supply chain, many farmers grow crops without knowing
  whether they'll be able to sell them. Moreover, the Farmers at CrowdFarming don't throw away "ugly fruit", as they abide
  to product-quality criteria instead of aesthetic-ones.</p>
